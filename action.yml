      Whether to post a comment.

      If set to true or always, this posts a comment to the pull
      request indicating whether the commits could be authenticated.

      If set to on-error (the default), a comment is only posted if
      the commits could not be authenticated.

      If false or never, no comment is posted.  The comment is
      still available via the comment output variable, and in the
      step's summary.
    default: on-error
outputs:

      The comment.

      A comment explaining whether commits could be authenticated.

      The comment is a JSON document with a single field, `body`.
